<h2 style="color: #323dfa; font-weight:500"> Bubble Sort </h2>
<p>
  Bubble Sort is simple sorting algorithm. It is slow sorting alogithm .It used loop for sorting. This algorithm used loop so Time Complexity is high.

**And Degree of Polynomial :- 2**

**Time Complexity is O(n^2) .**

Time Complexity is n^2 because here i used Two itarations .

<h2 style="color: #323dfa; font-weight:500"> Quick Sort </h2>
<p>
  Quick Sort is divide and conquer algorithms. Basically It has a pivot index . Using the pivot index it apply recursion . As, It is use recursion so it's time complexity will reduce

**Time Complexity is O(n log n)**

<h2 style="color: #323dfa; font-weight:500"> Singly Linked List </h2>
<p>
   Singly Linked List is a type of Data structure . Where it can used in store Data . In this List where every element has a Head and Tail . And every element pointing to tail . And it is a <strong> One Dircetional </strong> like <strong> Vector in Mathematices</strong>.
   We can add or remove element from the front, the end or from anywhere in the list. <strong style="color:red "> But in This project we can remove or add from last in list</strong>

<div>

<h2 style="color: #323dfa;font-weight:500;"> DFS </h2>
<p>
   DFS is searching technique in a Graph . DFS means Depth first search. In this technique search will happen in depth of tree if seaching node is found then search is complete but id searching node is not found . it will backtrack .

<div>

<h2 style="color: #323dfa; font-weight:500"> Dijkstra </h2>
<p>
 Dijkstra is very popular algorithms. It found the sortest path between two nodes . It works in weight grarph. To find the sortest path we can use adjecency matrix or adjecency list . Here i use adjecency List .
